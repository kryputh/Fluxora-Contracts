# Fluxora Stream Contract Documentation

Onboarding and integration reference for developers and auditors. Describes stream lifecycle, accrual formula, cliff/end_time behavior, access control, events, and error codes.

**Source of truth:** `contracts/stream/src/lib.rs`, `contracts/stream/src/accrual.rs`

**Alignment verification:** See [protocol-narrative-code-alignment.md](./protocol-narrative-code-alignment.md) for complete mapping between this documentation and implementation.

## Sync Checklist

When changing the contract:

- Update this doc if you change lifecycle, access control, events, or panic messages
- Update `protocol-narrative-code-alignment.md` to reflect changes
- Run `cargo test -p fluxora_stream` before committing
- Update snapshot tests if externally visible behavior changes
- No behavior change required for doc-only updates

## Externally Visible Assurances

This document provides crisp success and failure semantics for all protocol operations. Treasury operators, recipient applications, and auditors can reason about contract behavior using only:

1. **On-chain observables**: Persistent storage fields, emitted events, token transfers
2. **Published documentation**: This file and referenced specifications
3. **Error classifications**: Structured `ContractError` variants

No hidden rules or implementation details are required to understand protocol behavior.

## 1. Stream Lifecycle

### Phases

| Phase            | Action                                        | Notes                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Creation**     | `create_stream`                               | Sender deposits tokens; stream starts as `Active`                     |
| **Top-up**       | `top_up_stream`                               | Extra deposit locked (sender or admin only); schedule unchanged       |
| **Pause**        | `pause_stream` / `pause_stream_as_admin`      | Stops withdrawals; accrual continues by time                          |
| **Resume**       | `resume_stream` / `resume_stream_as_admin`    | Restores withdrawals; blocked if past `end_time` (Terminal)           |
| **Cancellation** | `cancel_stream` / `cancel_stream_as_admin`    | Refunds unstreamed amount; frozen accrued stays for recipient         |
| **Withdrawal**   | `withdraw` / `withdraw_to` / `batch_withdraw` | Recipient pulls accrued tokens; allowed on Paused if past `end_time`  |
| **Completion**   | Automatic                                     | When `withdrawn_amount == deposit_amount`, status becomes `Completed` |

### State Transitions

- **Active** ↔ **Paused** (via pause/resume)
- **Active** or **Paused** → **Cancelled** (terminal)
- **Active** or **Paused** → **Completed** (when recipient withdraws full deposit; terminal)

Terminal states: `Completed`, `Cancelled`. A stream is also considered technically terminal if `ledger.timestamp() >= end_time`.
In this "time-terminal" state, pause/resume is blocked, but withdrawal is always allowed regardless of previous pause status.

### Cancellation Semantics (Issue Scope)

This section is the protocol-level contract for `cancel_stream` and `cancel_stream_as_admin`.

Success semantics (observable):

1. Preconditions: stream status is `Active` or `Paused`.
2. `cancelled_at` is set to current ledger timestamp.
3. Accrued amount is frozen at `cancelled_at` (no post-cancel time growth).
4. Refund is `deposit_amount - accrued_at_cancelled_at`.
5. Stream transitions to terminal `Cancelled` state.
6. `StreamCancelled` event is emitted with topic `("cancelled", stream_id)`.

Failure semantics (observable):

1. Missing stream: `ContractError::StreamNotFound`.
2. Non-cancellable status (`Completed` or already `Cancelled`): `ContractError::InvalidState`.
3. Modification in terminal state (past `end_time` for pause/resume): `ContractError::StreamTerminalState`.
4. Unauthorized caller on sender path: `ContractError::Unauthorized`.
5. Unauthorized caller on admin path: `ContractError::Unauthorized`.
6. Redundant state change (pause already paused): `ContractError::StreamAlreadyPaused`.
7. Redundant state change (resume already active): `ContractError::StreamNotPaused`.
8. Any failure is atomic: no refund transfer, no state mutation, no cancel event.

Role boundaries:

1. `cancel_stream`: only the stream `sender` can authorize.
2. `cancel_stream_as_admin`: only contract `admin` can authorize.
3. Recipient and third parties cannot cancel through either path unless they hold required credentials.

Invariants after successful cancellation:

1. `status == Cancelled` and `cancelled_at.is_some()`.
2. `calculate_accrued(stream_id)` always returns accrued at `cancelled_at`.
3. `refund + frozen_accrued == deposit_amount`.
4. Recipient may withdraw only frozen accrued remainder (`frozen_accrued - withdrawn_amount`).

Scope boundary and exclusions:

1. In scope: refund math, `cancelled_at` persistence/freeze semantics, cancel auth paths, cancel event consistency.
2. Out of scope: token-level trust assumptions beyond documented model, off-chain indexer liveness, and economic policy choices (for example who should bear operational costs).
3. Residual risk: if a non-standard token violates SEP-41 expectations, transfer behavior may diverge; CEI ordering reduces but cannot fully eliminate external token risk.

### Global Pause Semantics (Issue Scope)

This section is the protocol-level contract for the global pause state managed via `set_contract_paused`.

Success semantics (observable):

1. Preconditions: Caller must be the authorized contract `admin`.
2. Storage: The `GlobalPaused` data key is set to `true` or `false` in instance storage.
3. Event: `ContractPaused(bool)` is emitted with topic `("paused_ctl",)`.
4. Effect on creation: When paused, `create_stream` and `create_streams` return `ContractError::ContractPaused` and all new stream creation is blocked.
5. Effect on existing streams: Active streams are intentionally unaffected. Withdrawals, top-ups, pause/resume/cancel operations on individual streams continue to function normally.

Failure semantics (observable):

1. Unauthorized caller on admin path: authorization failure from `admin.require_auth()`.
2. Any failure is atomic: no storage mutation, no event emitted.

Role boundaries:

1. `set_contract_paused`: only the contract `admin` can authorize.
2. Senders and recipients cannot pause the global contract. Senders manage individual streams via `pause_stream`.

Invariants when globally paused:

1. No new streams can be persisted (no `created` events, no deposit tokens pulled).
2. Existing streams do not change status due to a global pause.

Scope boundary: The global pause is strictly an administrative circuit breaker for new liabilities. It does not freeze funds of existing users or prevent recipients from withdrawing their vested entitlement.

## 2. Accrual Formula

**Location:** `contracts/stream/src/accrual.rs`

```text
if current_time < cliff_time           → return 0
if start_time >= end_time or rate < 0  → return 0

elapsed_now = min(current_time, end_time)
elapsed_seconds = elapsed_now - start_time   // 0 if underflow
accrued = elapsed_seconds * rate_per_second  // on overflow → deposit_amount
return min(accrued, deposit_amount).max(0)
```

### Rules

- **Before cliff:** Returns 0 (no withdrawals allowed)
- **After cliff:** Accrual computed from `start_time`, not from cliff
- **No cliff:** Set `cliff_time = start_time` for immediate vesting
- **After end_time:** Elapsed time is capped at `end_time` (no post-end accrual)
- **Overflow:** Multiplication overflow yields `deposit_amount` (safe upper bound)
- **Active streams:** Accrual computed using current ledger timestamp
- **Paused streams:** Accrual computed using current ledger timestamp (same as Active; pause only blocks withdrawals, not accrual)
- **Completed:** `calculate_accrued` returns `deposit_amount` (deterministic final value, timestamp-independent)
- **Cancelled:** `calculate_accrued` is frozen at `cancelled_at` (no post-cancel growth)

### Status-Specific Behavior Matrix

| Status    | Time Source            | Expected Behavior                      |
| --------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Active    | env.ledger().timestamp | Accrual grows with wall-clock time     |
| Paused    | env.ledger().timestamp | Same as Active (accrual continues)     |
| Completed | N/A (ignored)          | Returns deposit_amount (deterministic) |
| Cancelled | cancelled_at           | Frozen at cancellation time            |

### Withdrawable Amount

```text
withdrawable = accrued - withdrawn_amount
```

### Frontend: get_claimable_at (simulation)

`get_claimable_at(stream_id, timestamp)` is a read-only view that returns the amount that would be claimable (withdrawable) at an arbitrary timestamp. Use it for:

- **Planning:** "How much will be claimable at time T?" without sending a transaction.
- **Simulation:** Pass a future timestamp to show projected claimable amount.
- **Consistency:** For the current ledger time, result matches `get_withdrawable(stream_id)`.

Behaviour: Active/Paused streams use the given `timestamp` (clamped to schedule); Cancelled streams use `min(timestamp, cancelled_at)` so accrual is frozen at cancellation. Completed streams return 0.

---

## 3. Cliff and end_time Behavior

### Cliff

- Must be in `[start_time, end_time]` (enforced at creation)
- Before `cliff_time`: accrued = 0, no withdrawals
- At or after `cliff_time`: accrual uses elapsed time from `start_time`, not cliff

### end_time

- Must satisfy `start_time < end_time`
- Accrual uses `min(current_time, end_time)` as the upper bound
- After `end_time`, accrued stays at `min((end_time - start_time) * rate_per_second, deposit_amount)`
- No extra accrual beyond `end_time`

### Deposit Validation

At creation:

```text
deposit_amount >= rate_per_second * (end_time - start_time)
```

The same sufficiency check is enforced when extending a stream's `end_time`:

```text
deposit_amount >= rate_per_second * (new_end_time - start_time)
```

If the existing deposit does not cover the extended duration, `extend_stream_end_time` panics with `"deposit_amount must cover total streamable amount for extended schedule"` and no state changes occur. Use `top_up_stream` first to increase the deposit, then extend.

### Shorten `end_time` Semantics

`shorten_stream_end_time(stream_id, new_end_time)` is sender-only and only valid for `Active`/`Paused` streams.

Validation boundaries:
- `new_end_time > now`
- `new_end_time > start_time`
- `new_end_time >= cliff_time`
- `new_end_time < old_end_time`

On success:
- `new_deposit_amount = rate_per_second * (new_end_time - start_time)`
- `refund_amount = old_deposit_amount - new_deposit_amount`
- Contract persists `end_time` and `deposit_amount`, then transfers `refund_amount` to sender, then emits `end_shrt`.

On failure (`InvalidParams` or `InvalidState`):
- No state change
- No token transfer
- No `end_shrt` event

### Start Time Boundary (Creation)

- `start_time` **must be >= current ledger timestamp** at creation time.
- `start_time == now` is valid ("start now").
- `start_time < now` is rejected with `ContractError::StartTimeInPast`.
- Failure is atomic: no stream is persisted, no tokens move, and no `created` event is emitted.

**Limits Policy (Defense in Depth):**

- No arbitrary hard-coded caps (e.g. "max 1M tokens").
- The technical upper bound is `i128::MAX` or the underlying token's total supply.
- Rationale: Accrual math (in `accrual.rs`) is already overflow-safe via `checked_mul` and clamping.
- Application-specific limits should be handled in the frontend or factory contracts.

**Note:** Sender-managed functions (`pause_stream`, `resume_stream`, `cancel_stream`) require sender auth. Admin uses separate `_as_admin` entry points.

### batch_withdraw: completed stream behavior

`batch_withdraw` processes each stream ID in order. A stream with status `Completed` **does not panic** — it contributes a zero-amount result (`BatchWithdrawResult { stream_id, amount: 0 }`) and is skipped silently. No token transfer and no event are emitted for that entry. This allows callers to pass a mixed list of active and already-completed streams without pre-filtering.

A `Paused` stream **does** panic and reverts the entire batch.

### One-Shot Init and Immutable Bootstrap

`init(token, admin)` has explicit externally observable bootstrap semantics:

- One-shot: first successful call writes `Config { token, admin }` and `NextStreamId = 0`.
- Auth boundary: the supplied `admin` address must authorize the call.
- Re-init failure: any second call panics with `"already initialised"`.
- Failure atomicity: failed auth or re-init leaves bootstrap storage unchanged.
- Immutability boundary: `token` is immutable after init; `admin` can rotate only via `set_admin` with current-admin auth.

Residual assumption: deployment flow must ensure the intended bootstrap admin signs the first init transaction.

### create_streams: Batch Atomicity, Single Auth, and Empty Vector Semantics

`create_streams(sender, streams)` is the batch creation entrypoint for treasury operators and indexers.

#### Non-Empty Batch Semantics

- Single auth: only `sender` must authorize, and it is checked once for the entire batch.
- Batch validation: every entry is validated before token transfer or persistence.
- Atomic transfer: the contract pulls exactly `sum(deposit_amount)` once.
- Atomic persistence: if any entry fails validation (or total-deposit sum overflows), no stream is created.
- Event behavior: on success, one `created` event is emitted per created stream; on failure, no `created` events are emitted.
- Ordering guarantee: returned stream IDs are contiguous and in the same order as input entries.

#### Empty Vector Semantics

When `streams` is an empty vector:

**Success Behavior (Observable):**
- Returns `Ok(Vec::new())` (empty result vector)
- No tokens are transferred (total_deposit = 0, no `pull_token` call)
- No streams are persisted (stream count unchanged)
- No `StreamCreated` events are emitted
- Stream ID counter is not advanced
- Contract state remains unchanged
- Authorization is still required: `sender.require_auth()` is called and must succeed
- No errors are raised (empty batch is valid and succeeds)

**Failure Behavior (Observable):**
- If `sender` is not authorized: authorization failure before any state changes
- If contract is globally paused: `ContractError::ContractPaused` returned, no state changes
- Any failure is atomic: no state mutation, no token transfer, no events

**Invariants After Empty Batch:**
- Returned vector has length 0
- Stream count unchanged
- Token balances unchanged
- No new events in event log
- Recipient stream indices unchanged
- Multiple empty batches have identical observable effects (idempotent)

**Rationale:**
- Empty batch is a valid no-op: allows callers to submit conditional batches without special-casing
- Authorization is still required: maintains consistent auth semantics across all entry points
- No state advance: ensures stream IDs remain contiguous and predictable
- Idempotent: enables safe retry logic in integrators

#### Scope Note

These guarantees are limited to `create_streams` creation semantics. They do not change withdrawal, pause/resume, cancellation, or cleanup rules.

### batch_withdraw: Recipient-Only Auth, Completed Stream Handling, and Empty Vector Semantics

`batch_withdraw(recipient, stream_ids)` enforces recipient-only authorization and deterministic completion semantics:

#### Non-Empty Batch Semantics

- Auth boundary: only the stream `recipient` can authorize `batch_withdraw`.
- Non-recipient calls fail before transfer/state/event side effects.
- Uniqueness check: `stream_ids` must not contain duplicates; duplicates panic and revert the entire batch.
- Completed streams: contribute a zero-amount result and are skipped silently (no error, no event).
- Active/Paused streams: processed normally; `Paused` streams panic and revert the entire batch.
- Event ordering on active final drain: `withdrew` is emitted before `completed`.

#### Empty Vector Semantics

When `stream_ids` is an empty vector:

**Success Behavior (Observable):**
- Returns `Ok(Vec::new())` (empty result vector)
- No streams are processed
- No tokens are transferred
- No events are emitted
- Contract state remains unchanged
- Authorization is still required: `recipient.require_auth()` is called and must succeed
- No errors are raised (empty batch is valid and succeeds)

**Failure Behavior (Observable):**
- If `recipient` is not authorized: authorization failure before any state changes
- If contract is globally paused: `ContractError::ContractPaused` returned, no state changes
- Any failure is atomic: no state mutation, no token transfer, no events

**Invariants After Empty Batch:**
- Returned vector has length 0
- No stream state changed
- Token balances unchanged
- No new events in event log
- Multiple empty batches have identical observable effects (idempotent)

**Rationale:**
- Empty batch is a valid no-op: allows callers to submit conditional batches without special-casing
- Authorization is still required: maintains consistent auth semantics across all entry points
- Idempotent: enables safe retry logic in integrators

## 6. Error Behavior (ContractError + Panics)

Errors are surfaced either as `ContractError` variants or as panic/assert messages.
Integrators should treat `ContractError` as stable error codes, and panic strings
as best-effort diagnostics. The table below focuses on creation and lifecycle
errors relevant to stream creation and timing.

| Message                                                                 | Function                           | Trigger                                       |
