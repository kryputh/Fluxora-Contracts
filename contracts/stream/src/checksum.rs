/// WASM build reproducibility — checksum verification contract.
///
/// This module documents and tests the invariants that the CI checksum
/// verification relies on. It does NOT perform I/O or read files; instead
/// it validates the properties that guarantee reproducible builds from
/// the contract's own configuration (toolchain pin, SDK pin, build flags).
///
/// # Determinism contract
///
/// The following invariants must hold for a build to be reproducible:
///
/// 1. **Rust toolchain** is pinned via `rust-toolchain.toml` to a specific
///    channel (`stable`) and target set (`wasm32-unknown-unknown`).
/// 2. **soroban-sdk** version is pinned in `contracts/stream/Cargo.toml`
///    (currently `21.7.7`).
/// 3. **Build profile** is `--release` with `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target.
/// 4. **No feature flags** beyond the default are used during WASM builds
///    (the `testutils` feature is only for `#[cfg(test)]`).
/// 5. **No environment-dependent code** is compiled into the WASM artifact.
///
/// If any of these invariants change, the reference checksum in
/// `wasm/checksums.sha256` must be regenerated via
/// `script/update-wasm-checksums.sh`.
///
/// # CI verification flow
///
/// 1. CI builds the WASM artifact with the pinned toolchain.
/// 2. CI computes `sha256sum` of the built WASM.
/// 3. CI compares the computed hash against `wasm/checksums.sha256`.
/// 4. If the hashes differ, CI fails with an actionable error message
///    directing the developer to regenerate the checksums.
///
/// # Residual risks
///
/// - **Optimized WASM**: The Stellar CLI `optimize` step may produce
///   non-deterministic output depending on the CLI version. The reference
///   checksum covers only the raw (unoptimized) WASM, which is deterministic
///   given the pinned toolchain and dependencies.
/// - **Dependency resolution**: `Cargo.lock` must be committed and unchanged.
///   If a transitive dependency publishes a new patch version, `cargo build`
///   will still use the locked version.
/// - **Host toolchain differences**: The CI runs on `ubuntu-latest`. Building
///   on a different OS or architecture may produce different output for
///   non-WASM targets, but the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is
///   cross-compilation and should be deterministic across hosts.

// This module is conditionally compiled only for tests.
// It serves as documentation for the checksum verification process.
